# Spotify data and COVID-19 lockdown patterns

### The core concept of the module-1 project is to use Spotify's API and Spotipy for web scraping to analyze country-level listening patterns and if they were influenced by COVID-19 measures. For example:
*How did the "mood" of the Top Charts from countries change after the government responses to COVID-19 became more strict?*
 
(Note for us) : we originally wanted to look at city-level to examine Seattle, London, Seoul, etc. to look at how listeners' music taste may have become more meloncholy, but this data isn't available at the city-level. 
 
(Note for us) :
