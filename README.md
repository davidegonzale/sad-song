# Sad Songs: Feeling lonely around the globe 

## Spotify listening trends and COVID-19 lockdown patterns

### The core concept of the module-1 project is to use Spotify's API and Spotipy to analyze the general "mood" of the top charts at the country-level. Next, we want to look at the stringency of national policy responses to COVID-19, which we took from the Oxford Government Response Tracker. We wanted to see if the general "mood" of the music streamed was influenced by COVID-19 measures.
