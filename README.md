# Sad Songs: Feeling lonely around the globe 

## Spotify listening trends and COVID-19 lockdown patterns

### The core concept of the module-1 project is to use Spotify's API and Spotipy to analyze the general "mood" of the top charts at the country level. Next, we want to look at the stringency of national policy responses to COVID-19, which we took from the Oxford Government Response Tracker. We wanted to see if the general "mood" of the music streamed was influenced by COVID-19 stay at home measures.

*In this repo you will find:*
 * Jupyter Notebook: "spotify_api.ipynb" with all data wrangled with Spotify API and preliminary analysis
 * Jupyter Notebook: "ox_covid_test.ipynb" with the data taken from Oxford dataset and cleaned/subsetted to show stay at home requirements
 * Jupyter Notebook: "together_test.ipynb" that puts together our COVID and Spotify dataframes for more plotting and analysis
 * All .csv files with imported data and the dataframes we made
 * Folder "data" with the Oxford database
 * Folder "Spotify_regional" with all the country charts (Top 200 songs, April 2019-September 2020)
 * Folder "Misc. extra" with non-essential files
